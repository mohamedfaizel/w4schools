        <strong>Tips to build a good Apps</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Use Error Interceptors</li>
            <li>Use route guards to prevent unauthorized users to access specific screens</li>
            <li>Use Interfaces to create objects for data coming from the API</li>
            <li>Use Components as much as possible</li>
            <li>Route Resolvers instead of Safe Navigation operators</li>
            <li>So data is got from the API by the service which then gives it to the resolver which then gives it to the component</li>
            <li>Use hostlistener so that forms that take data inform the user if they are trying to navigate away from them without saving the information</li>
            <li>Use BehaviourSubject observable to communicate between components that don't have a parent child relationship</li>
            <li>Use the above to reduce network calls to the database</li>
            <li>Use Reactive forms and Form builders with validators and custom validators for designing forms</li>
            <li>Use time ago pipes for showing dates/last sent data/last activity etc</li>
        </ul>
